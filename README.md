## Introduction

EduBoard is a digital whiteboard application designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and dynamic interaction in educational and professional settings. Whether you're sketching out ideas, organizing thoughts with sticky notes, or annotating concepts, EduBoard provides a flexible and user-friendly canvas for your digital workspace. My aim is to offer a streamlined and accessible alternative for educators and learners seeking a straightforward digital whiteboard experience.

## Purpose and Vision

The primary goal of EduBoard is to provide a simple yet effective tool for:

* **Brainstorming:** Capture and connect ideas visually in a free-form environment.
* **Visual Collaboration:** (Future Goal) Enable multiple users to work together on the same board in real-time.
* **Educational Engagement:** Serve as an interactive teaching and learning aid, allowing educators and students to illustrate concepts, solve problems, and share notes dynamically.
* **Quick Note-Taking & Ideation:** A space to quickly jot down thoughts, create mind maps, or plan projects.

## Current Features

EduBoard currently supports the following functionalities:

* **Drawing Tools:**
    * **Pen:** Freehand drawing with selectable colors and line widths.
    * **Eraser:** Erase pen strokes.
* **Sticky Notes:**
    * Create digital sticky notes on the canvas.
    * Add text directly onto the notes.
    * Move sticky notes around the canvas.
* **Canvas Management:**
    * **Undo/Redo:** Step backward or forward through your recent actions.
    * **Clear Frame:** Erase all content from the canvas.
    * **Responsive Canvas:** Adapts to your browser window size.
